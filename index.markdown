The Qualifying Tournament

Our Mission Strategy
	Our mission strategy was to do the closest missions first, because then it would save us more time during the tournaments, since we only have 2 minutes and 30 seconds to run our code in the tournaments. Here is our tri-fold for our mission strategy and code:
